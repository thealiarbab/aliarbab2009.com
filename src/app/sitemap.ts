/**
 * Auto-generated sitemap for aliarbab2009.com.
 * Served at /sitemap.xml by Next 15 App Router conventions.
 *
 * Priorities (deliberate, not the default Google fudge):
 *   1.0  /              the funnel entry point
 *   0.9  /projects      primary content hub
 *   0.9  /about         long-form admissions-ready story
 *   0.8  /projects/<slug>           detail pages
 *   0.7  /resume        secondary, but updated more often than /contact
 *   0.7  /contact       low edit frequency, still indexable
 *
 * lastModified is sourced from siteConfig.lastReviewedISO (static
 * pages) or project.lastUpdatedISO (project detail pages, falling
 * back to lastReviewedISO when absent). ISO strings ship with the
 * bundle so we never tell Google "everything was edited just now"
 * on every crawl — that's noise.
 *
 * No # anchors: Google discourages them and they bloat the sitemap.
 *
 * Phase 1+ /projects/<slug>/diagrams routes don't exist yet — kept
 * commented below for one-line activation when they ship.
 *
 * Per P4.03.
